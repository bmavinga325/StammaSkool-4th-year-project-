# StammaSkool-4th-year-project-
The main aim of this project was to develop an easy-to-use mobile speech therapy app that is  usable for all ages. This application will also serve as an everyday support system for people  who suffer from a stammer or speech impediment. The features within the application should  work as a self-management tool that will help users build confidence in their speech and  delivery. It is also designed to track progress and to provide users with a visual representation  of how they are doing and how they can improve. Since no one method helps every (pws) all  features are tailored to help most individuals
